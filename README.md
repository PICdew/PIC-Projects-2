**I have been using PICs on and off for personal projects and for work since 2010.Here are some personal projects I have done myself using Microchip's PICs:**


**P1-16F688LM35 - Thermometer with PIC16F688 and LM35:**
One of ADC channels of PIC16F688 was used to convert LM35's (temperature sensor) voltage output into digital.Using this digitized and manipulated data,through a BCD-to-7-segment display converter,current temperature between 0*C to 50*C is displayed on 7-segment displays.
